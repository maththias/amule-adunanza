Basic instructions to get amuled up and running
===============================================

This document should guide you into successfully running the aMule
daemon, amuled.

Start with invoking the daemon once. From a terminal, write:

    $ amuled-adunanza

It will create and populate an ~/.aMuleAdunanzA directory if you don't have one,
and will probably abort with an error like this:

    ERROR: aMule daemon cannot be used when external connections are disabled.
    To enable External Connections, use either a normal aMule or set the key
    "AcceptExternalConnections" to 1 in the file ~/.aMuleAdunanzA/amule.conf.

So, with an editor, edit the ~/.aMuleAdunanzA/amule.conf file, search for the
line containing "AcceptExternalConnections", and change the 0 to 1.
If you run the daemon now, it will complain like this:

    ERROR: A valid password is required to use external connections, and
    aMule daemon cannot be used without external connections. To run
    aMule daemon, you must set the "ECPassword" field in the file
    ~/.aMuleAdunanzA/amule.conf with an appropriate value.

The "ECPassword" needs an MD5 hash of your password, which can be
computed with a simple procedure. For example, if you want your password
to be "touche", you'd calculate the value for "ECPassword" like this:

    $ echo -n "touche" | md5sum | awk '{print $1}'
    75dfa1c8b9f1b1d8e599f2ed98f1ecd0

Once you've edit ~/.aMuleAdunanzA/amule.conf again to set ECPassword, you'll be
able to run amuled. If you want it to go to the background, so that you
can close the terminal, do:

    $ amuled -f


Controlling the daemon
======================

If all went well, the daemon will listen in port 4712 and will accept
connections from external programs like amulecmd and amulegui. If no
firewall blocks the connections, it should be possible to connect from
remote hosts too.


Using aMuleWeb
==============

The daemon can also be controlled via a web interface. To have it start
automatically when the daemon starts, search in ~/.aMule/amule.conf the
"[WebServer]" section and set "Enabled" to 1, and "Password" to the same
as ECPassword above, or any other hash computed with the same method. It
will listen on port 4711 by default, and can also be started by hand
with the following command:
    
    $ amuleweb-adunanza --amule-config-file=~/.aMuleAdunanzA/amule.conf

The address to access the page is http://localhost:4711 if accessing from
the same computer, or http://IP_OR_REMOTE_NAME:4711 if not.


Init script
===========

The amule-adunanza-daemon package ships an init script in /etc/init.d. You can
use this script to automatically start amuled on every system boot. To
enable it, edit the file /etc/default/amule-adunanza-daemon and give a value to
the AMULED_USER variable (this should be normally your username, or some
other if you wish to run amuled under a separate account).
